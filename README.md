# Libertarian Fact Sheet
Hey libertarians, it would be great to expand this google doc to contain a plethora of information and we would need multiple people to help contribute to this. If you have any information you would like to add, please email me at ernojames@gmail.com (yes, it's a fake email). You can send me new information or new possible sections to add to this document. You can literally email me any political information and rebuttals you want that follow the standards of libertarianism. If  you have a lot of information that you would like to add periodically, I can maybe give you edit access to the document. Please keep in mind this is not officially done in any manner, as I will continue to add new info covering many studies and debunks to help other libertarians. Thank you!

### People's Republic of Walmart 
* [No, Walmart Is Not Evidence That Centrally‐Planned Economies Work](https://www.cato.org/commentary/no-walmart-not-evidence-centrally-planned-economies-work)
  * The People's Republic of Walmart is not a solution to the Economic Calculation Problem, Walmart uses prices to determine whether or not to do certain things, they still have a common denominator to compare different factors of production to commensurate them. 

### Market Socialism 
* [Murphy '15 (Page 243)](https://b-ok.cc/book/2575122/5fdeaa?id=2575122&secret=5fdeaa)
  * Mises remarks that the proposal of market socialism is “nothing short of a full acknowledgement of the correctness and irrefutability of the economists’ analysis and devastating critique” of socialism. Historically, the appeal of socialism was the entire abolition of the crass marketplace with its haggling and commodification of workers; yet now, Mises points out, the leading socialist intellectuals acknowledge that under socialism, too, it will be necessary to have prices and competition. Yet even these concessions do not save the socialist project. Such proposals “look at the economic problem from the perspective of the subaltern clerk.” It is not enough to ask a socialist factory manager to take the announced vector of prices and produce the amount of output that will maximize profit according to these numbers. The much more fundamental questions are: Should this factory remain in operation at all? Should new factories be built—and if so, where, and what size? To answer such questions, the socialist planner cannot resort to a simulated market. She cannot, as some theorists suggested, act as a bank and administer funds to various competing promoters because some of the potential borrowers will exaggerate the viability of their projects. Ultimately, the planner must make the final decision on how to allocate all of society's funds. “Then we are back again where we started: the director...is not aided by the division of intellectual labor which under capitalism provides a practicable method for economic calculation.”

### Debunking Paul Cockshott
* He fails to control for industry size 
  * [Nitzan '09](https://bnarchives.yorku.ca/259/2/20090522_nb_casp_full_indexed.pdf) 
    * With regards to the concept of prices, most people think of this concept as attributes of individual commodities – the price of a Toyota Corolla. Price could also be an attribute of a group of commodities. The GDP deflator of the beverage industry, for instance, denotes the weighted average price of all newly produced commodities in that industry, while similar deflators express the weighted average price for entire sectors such as consumer and investment goods, or even the economy as a whole. Marxist studies of price–value correlations, however, deal with neither of these concepts. Instead of looking at the price of a single commodity or the average price of a group of commodities, they focus on the price of total output – that is, on the unit price of the commodity multiplied by its quantity. Typically, the researcher divides an economy into a few dozen sectors as delineated by the national statistical service, estimates the price and value of total output in each of these sectors, and then correlates these two magnitudes across sectors for one or more years. This shift in focus has significant statistical implications. Correlations measured in this way reflect the co-variations not only of unit prices and values, but also of their associated quantities. Now, note that the unit value and unit price of each sector are multiplied by the same output. This fact means that, all other things being equal, the greater the size-variability of output across the different sectors, the tighter the correlation between their total prices and total value. And since different sectors do vary in their output size, the common result is to make the overall correlation bigger than the underlying correlation between unit prices and values. The extent of this impact is revealed when sectors are controlled for their size: the value–price correlations become insignificant. 

### Calculation In Kind
* [From Marx to Mises (pg 220-231)](https://b-ok.cc/book/2352922/f6d9b5) 
  * Calculation in kind calculus would require the comparison of innumerable processes and raw materials and these in and of themselves would not reveal the preferable course of action. Only profit and loss signals can reveal to producers whether or not they made the rational decision, and profit and loss signals require a monetary calculus. It’s these price signals that enable the producers to choose between raw materials (as the money prices of members of a set of possible raw materials allow producers to calculate the # of money needed to produce 1 unit of a good, -> and thereby predict profitability). For example, let's say that copper is more costly than aluminum and therefore should be reserved for more urgent applications, or method of production x has some advantages over method of production y, but uses up too great a quantity of valuable resources, so we are better off plumping for y. Such comparative judgments require the ability to assess the costs of copper, aluminum, and all other resources, in the same units, and in units which do not differ from case to case. Since calculation in kind permits no mechanism that would enable the administration to make such judgments, it is not clear what sense we can make of calculation in kind allocating the factors of production properly in a socialist society. 

### China
* [CEI '17](https://cei.org/blog/why-economic-freedom-is-the-best-weapon-against-poverty/) 
  * The rise of China is historical proof that economic freedom is the greatest driver of prosperity. China was previously governed under central planning, with little respect for individual freedom. They eventually began to give this up after 1978. After the partial freeing of markets, they started growing exponentially, at 7 to 12 percent, up from miserable rates of around 2 percent. While China is not close to being entirely economically free, they have still drastically improved their scores, opening up markets to international trade, deregulating the economy, and allowing individuals to exchange voluntarily. This has led to the greatest reduction in absolute poverty the world has ever seen.

### South Korea
* [CEI '17](https://cei.org/blog/why-economic-freedom-is-the-best-weapon-against-poverty/) 
  * South Korea is another example of the success of economic freedom. They were a desperately poor country just 60 years ago, it is now one of the wealthiest in the world. It makes for a particularly interesting comparison with the African nation of Ghana, as Ghana and South Korea had the same GDP per capita in 1957. Since then, South Korea has embraced foreign investment, liberalized trade, and strong property rights. Ghana, instead, went down another path, with a socialist government that was propped up by foreign aid. By 1990, South Korea’s GDP was 10 times that of Ghana. By 2015, Ghana’s GDP per capita sits at just under $2,000, while South Korea is over $25,000. This was while Ghana was receiving enormous amounts of foreign aid, whereas South Korea received substantially less. More importantly, the aid South Korea did receive did not dominate its domestic policy like it did in Ghana.

### USSR and NEP
After the fall of the communist USSR, the area became more free market and economic growth had a major increase following:
* [Earle '98](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.2307/2698243)
  * This study examines whether privatization enhanced efficiency in Russia after the fall of the USSR. It finds that a 10% increase in private share ownership raises real sales per employee by 3-5%. Productivity also saw a major increase after privatizations 
* [NEP was capitalist, free-enterprise, and market-oriented](http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1921-2/the-new-economic-policy/) 
* [Standard of Living Increased during NEP](https://cdn.mises.org/5_1_5_0.pdf) 
* [Agricultural Output Restored to 1913 Levels](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1g69x9s.12?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) 
* [No famines in the midst of NEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_and_famines_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union#1920s) 

## Why High Taxes or Increasing Taxes is Detrimental
* [Economics in One Lesson pg 23-25](http://leeconomics.com/Literature/Henry%20Hazlitt%20Economics%20in%20One%20Lesson.pdf) 
  * While people dilate the benefits of party B when taxed they forget about A. Which is obvious when allocating money from A to B.
  * Taxes affect the incentives of an individual.
  * When a business, lets say, gains 52 cents per dollar they gain and losses 100 cents per dollar they lose and cannot adequately offset losses and gains can  lead to businesses not expanding or only expanding enterprises of minimum risk. 
  * People who see this are deterred from starting new businesses, suppressing capitalistic competition. 
  * Thus old employers give less employment. 
  * The speed of which new technology and machinery are slowed
  * The consequences in the long run is that consumers miss out on obtaining cheaper more quality products and workers get lower wages. 
  * Think about it: in countries with 50,60,70 percent income taxes people wonder why they should have to work 8,9,10 months out of the year for the government
  * It is conspicuous that hoarding of capital and/or holding onto accumulation hurts the economy, therefore when a person loses 100% of what they get when lost but only gets to keep 50% of what they gain, leading to capital accumulation. It is taxed faster than can be accumulated. Therefore, leading to unemployment [1,2,3]
  * Larger percent of taxes, the bigger deterrent to private production and employment. Taken too far, the devastation of taxation becomes insoluble.
  
## Why Low Taxes or Decreasing Taxes is Beneficial
* [Olea ‘18](https://taxfoundation.org/reviewing-recent-evidence-effect-taxes-economic-growth/) 
  * Marginal rate cuts led to both increases in real GDP and declines in unemployment. A 1 percentage-point decrease in the tax rate increases real GDP by 0.78 percent by the third year after the tax change.
